            <p>In this sentence verb/action emphasis task, you are given 100 sentences, each with a verb that appeared in the sentence for you to emphasize. The verb will be in double brackets. Your task is to rewrite each sentence to emphasize the given verb action. If the rewrite is impossible or the given emphasis isn't a verb or action, write capitalized "N/A" in the answer line.</p>
            <p>Typically, the verb action emphasis can be done by making the verb a noun and move it to the front.</p>
            <p>If you're asked to emphasize a verb outside a quotation (such as emphasizing "said" in "'...' said someone"), you may put "N/A" as the answer.</p>
            <p style="color:red">Note that the original sentences have all punctuations removed. Your rewritten sentences should have all punctuations removed too.</p>
            <p>When you are done, click "submit" and copy the generated json text to the google form with link on the left side of the page.</p>
            <b>Examples:</b>
            <p>Original Sentence: We continue to [[develop]] products faster than anyone else can</p>     
            <p>Your Answer: <u>Development</u> of products faster than anyone else can is continuously done by us.</p>    
            <p>Original Sentence: In offices triphosphorous bulbs [[simulate]] daylight</p>     
            <p>Your Answer: <u>Simulation</u> of daylight is done in offices by triphosphorous bulbs</p>    
            <p>Original Sentence: But [[does]] it have to go so soon</p>
