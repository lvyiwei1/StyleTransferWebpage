        <full-instructions header="Information Addition Instructions">
            <p>In this task, you are given 200 sentences and your goal is to add a specific piece of new information to each sentence. Each piece of information is either an attribute or a relation. An attribute is presented as a 2-tuple of words (object, attribute) such as ("sky","blue"). A relation is presented as a 3-tuple of words (object, relation, object) such as ("cup", "on", "table").</p>
            <p>You are required to rewrite the sentence incorporating the additional information. Your rewritten sentence must be grammatical. If adding the information is impossible or the additional information does not fit the content of the original sentence, write capitalized "N/A" as your answer.</p>
            <p style="color:red">Note that the original sentences have all punctuations removed. Your rewritten sentences should have all punctuations removed too.</p>
            <p>When you are done, click "submit" and copy the generated json text to the google form with link on the left side of the page.</p>
