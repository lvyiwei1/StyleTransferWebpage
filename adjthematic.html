            <p>In this sentence adjective/attribute emphasis task, you are given 100 sentences, each with an adjective that appeared in the sentence in double brackets for you to emphasize. Your task is to rewrite each sentence to emphasize the given adjective. If the rewrite is impossible or if the given adjective is already emphasized in the original sentence, write capitalized "N/A" in the answer line.</p>
            <p style="color:red">Note that the original sentences have all punctuations removed. Your rewritten sentences should have all punctuations removed too.</p>
            <p>When you are done, click "submit" and copy the generated json text to the google form with link on the left side of the page.</p>
           
          <div>
            <b>Typically, the emphesis can be done by rewritting the whole sentence as a BE-statement about the adjective.</b>
            <p>Examples:</p>

            <p>Original sentence: The big brown fox jumps over the [[sleazy]] dog.</p>
            <p>Your answer: The dog that is jumped over by the big brown fox <u>is sleazy</u>. </p>
            <p>Original sentence: In order to catch the [[yellow]] frog, the workers drained the lake.</p>
            <p>Your answer: The frog which the workers drained the lake to catch <u>is yellow</u>. </p>
           </div>    

           
           <div>
            <b>Example for already emphasized adjective: </b>
            <p>Original sentence: [[Great]] was the fall of it. </p>
            <p>Your answer: N/A</p>
