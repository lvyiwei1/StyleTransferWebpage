        <full-instructions header="Information Addition Instructions">
            <p>In this sentence information addition task, you are given 100 sentences, each with a set of attributes or relations as "additional information". Your task is to rewrite each sentence incorporating additional information. Note that since the additional informations are extracted automatically from Visual Genome knowledge base, some attributes or relations in the given additional information may not fit the sentence. You are required to first select the attributes and relations that fit the sentence, and then rewrite the sentence using the attributes and relations you selected. If no additional information is appropriate or the rewrite is impossible, write capitalized "N/A" in the answer line. When you are done, click submit.</p>
            <p>Note that the original sentences have all punctuations removed. Your rewritten sentences should have all punctuations removed too.</p>
            <p>Here are some examples:</p>
            <p>Original Sentence: The company has been manufacturing carpet since 1967</p>    
            <p>Additional information: [(’company’, ’ON’, ’building’), (’company’, ’name’), (’carpet’, ’ON’, ’oor’), (’carpet’, ’brown’)]</p>
            <p>Your answer: The company in the building has been manufacturing brown floor carpet since 1967</p>
